# DevChallengePack

**DevChallengePack** is a collection of programming tasks implemented in C#. This repository demonstrates solutions to a series of common coding challenges, with a focus on functionality, unit testing, and scalability.

## Features

1. **FizzBuzz**: A function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, with special rules for multiples of 3 ("Fizz"), multiples of 5 ("Buzz"), and multiples of both 3 and 5 ("FizzBuzz"). Unit tests are included to ensure the function works as expected.

2. **Prime Numbers**: A function that returns the first `x` prime numbers. This function is thoroughly tested with unit tests to guarantee its accuracy.

3. **Workplace Booking API**: A simple REST API for managing workplace bookings. It includes functionality for booking a workplace, checking API keys for security, and tracking API performance with mock repository support. Unit tests ensure proper API key validation and performance tracking.

4. **Birthday Greetings**: A system that sends personalized birthday greetings to a list of friends. The implementation is designed to be easily adaptable to changes in the greeting message, data source, or delivery method (e.g., email, WhatsApp). Unit tests are included to verify functionality.

Each solution is accompanied by comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.
